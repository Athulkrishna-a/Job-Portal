- **Add Jobs:** Create and add new job postings to the portal.
- **Update Jobs:** Modify details of existing job listings.
- **Delete Jobs:** Remove job listings from the portal.
- **Search Jobs:** Search for specific job listings based on criteria like job title, company, location, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Framework for building the backend application.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system used for storing job listings.
- **Hibernate:** ORM tool for handling database operations in an object-oriented manner.
